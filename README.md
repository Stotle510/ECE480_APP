# ECE480_APP
Cancer symptom management app that is compatible with iOS devises. 

Two of the most debilitating symptoms of cancer include sleep/wake disturbance and fatigue occurring during chemotherapy. This is due to the disruptions in circadian rhythm caused by chemotherapy required to treat certain cases of cancer. Circadian rhythm is the natural internal process that regulates sleep cycles. Light is one of the biggest factors in regulating circadian rhythm, and we aim to create a smartphone application that assists in bright light therapy by adhering to a strict schedule in an effort to better manage sleep/wake disturbance and fatigue. Bright light therapy is typically performed by using bright lights to create stimuli in cells of the retina that in turn travel to the part of the brain that helps regulate circadian rhythm. Along with assisting in light therapy, this application will also provide a log to better track sleep and wake times.

Traversal of the application's UI is very straightforward. Below are the basic instructions on how to use each of the application’s functionalities. 

Log-in: The log-in screen is the first you encounter while using the application. You must type in your username that was issued to you by the nurse and press “continue to home screen”. If no username is entered the application will not allow you to access the home screen. Once you have accessed the home screen all further data that is input to the app will be filed under the username you typed in the log-in.

Wake-up/Nap/Bedtime Questions: Baseline questions to ask you about their mood or wellbeing when you first wake up or before you go to bed. Simply answer all the questions as you see fit and press the submit button. You will be taken to a confirmation screen where you can then return to the home screen.

Start Light Vision Timer: This timer will start when you are ready to start your daily light therapy session. It has 30 min duration and starting this timer deactivates all future reminders for that day and logs the session to the database when complete.

My Info: Allows access to your personal information, account info, and has the ability to change your username.

Help: This section of the application contains two videos that show what your light vision package contains and how to set the visor up.

Set Reminders: The function that allows you to set custom reminders for the time that light therapy works best for you. Simply input what time of day you would like to be reminded and you will receive a reminder notification.
